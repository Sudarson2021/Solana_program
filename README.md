# Cross-Chain NFT Ticket System with Ethereum, Solana, and Wormhole

## Project Overview

Welcome to our submission for the [Hackathon Name]! Our project implements a sophisticated cross-chain Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ticket system leveraging the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, seamlessly connected through the Wormhole protocol. Our solution offers an innovative approach to ticketing, ensuring secure, decentralized, and interoperable ticket management for various events, concerts, conferences, and more.

## Key Features

- **Interoperable Ticket Management**: Seamlessly manage NFT tickets across both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, enabling users to access events irrespective of their preferred blockchain network.
- **Wormhole Integration**: Utilize the cutting-edge Wormhole protocol for efficient cross-chain communication, facilitating the seamless transfer of NFT tickets between Ethereum and Solana.
- **Enhanced Security and Transparency**: Leverage the inherent security and transparency of blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof ticket issuance, ownership verification, and transfer mechanisms.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Built on scalable blockchain infrastructures like Ethereum and Solana, our solution ensures high throughput, low latency, and cost-effective ticket management, even during peak event periods.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For Ethereum Smart Contract: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install OpenZeppelin Contracts:
     ```
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
     ```
   - For Solana Program: Set up your Solana development environment and install the necessary dependencies for Rust and Solana programming.

4. **Compile and Deploy Contracts**:
   - Compile and deploy the Ethereum smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
   - Compile and deploy the Solana program on the Solana blockchain using tools like Anchor or Solana CLI.

5. **Interact with the Contracts**:
   - Use Ethereum-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the Ethereum smart contract.
   - Use Solana-compatible wallets (e.g., Sollet) to interact with the Solana program.

## Usage

1. **Minting Tickets**:
   - Mint new NFT tickets using the provided function in the Ethereum smart contract.
   - Mint new NFT tickets using the provided function in the Solana program.

2. **Transferring Tickets**:
   - Transfer NFT tickets between users on Ethereum using standard ERC-721 transfer functions.
   - Transfer NFT tickets between users on Solana using SPL Token transfer functions.
   - Transfer NFT tickets between Ethereum and Solana using the Wormhole bridge.

3. **Querying Ownership**:
   - Query ownership of NFT tickets on Ethereum by calling the appropriate function in the Ethereum smart contract.
   - Query ownership of NFT tickets on Solana by inspecting token accounts using Solana tools.
